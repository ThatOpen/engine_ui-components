Take note of the following web component:

$Open file

Generate a well-documented JSDoc for these web component properties $Selected code. For each property, you MUST analice the full code and include in the JSDoc a detailed description of the property making sure to mention what to expect when the property changes. You must include the following tags:

- @type showing the data type of the property. It must only show the data type, nothing more.
- @default showing the property default value based on the constructor. It must only contain its default value, nothing more.
- @example showing how to use the property in HTML. It must only contain the code snippet, nothing more.
- @example showing how to use the property in JavaScript, making sure the code snippet includes the instancing of the web component. It must only contain the code snippet, nothing more.

Give me the answer in just one code snippet and after each JSDoc write the property declaration again so I can just copy-paste your answer.
